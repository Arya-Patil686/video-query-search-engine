# 🎥 Video Query-Based Search Engine

## 🧠 Overview
This project enables users to search for specific scenes in videos by using an image as a query. The system processes and compares the input image against preprocessed frames from videos stored in a local database, and retrieves the most visually similar segments.

It is useful for quickly locating visual content in video datasets — such as identifying a scene from a movie, an object in surveillance footage, or educational clips.
